README

Program description:
--------------------
jasm6502 is a cross assembler running on any java enabled platform.
The assembler, when properly set up and invoked from the command line, is capable of compiling one or multiple sourcefile into a binary for 6502 cpu based systems.
The features includes the essential utilities such as labels, basic mathematical expressions, identifiers, byte/word strings, and nestable procedures with their own namespace.
Any block of 6502 assembler source text may be output to a given origin in the binary. Unused space is padded with zeroes.

Compiling:
----------
You need java sdk version 1.4 and higher installed, and have the java compiler (javac) in your path.
Then use the command line to change into the jasm6502 source code directory and enter either:

$ javac AbstractAssembler.java AbstractLexer.java AbstractParser.java AsciiTranslator.java Assembler6502.java C64LowerCaseTranslator.java C64UpperCaseTranslator.java Evaluator.java InfixToPostfix.java jasm6502.java Lexer6502.java LexerException.java MachineCode6502.java Namespace.java Parser6502.java ParserException.java Symbol.java SymbolConstant6502.java SymbolTable.java

or

$ jar cvfm jasm6502.jar manifest AbstractAssembler.class AbstractLexer.class AbstractParser.class AsciiTranslator.class Assembler6502.class C64LowerCaseTranslator.class C64UpperCaseTranslator.class Evaluator.class InfixToPostfix.class jasm6502.class Lexer6502.class LexerException.class MachineCode6502.class Namespace.class Parser6502.class ParserException.class Symbol.class SymbolConstant6502.class SymbolTable.class

To produce a normal compilation, or a jar file. 

Running:
--------

First put the directory containing the compiled jasm6502 class files/jar-file in your PATH variable.
If you compiled jasm6502 into a jar, another option is copying the jar directly into the directory containing the 6502 source files you will assemble.
Then invoke jasm6502,
$ java jasm6502 source.asm
	or
$ java -jar jasm6502 source.asm

Invoking without a source file argument will produce a simple message on usage and program arguments.
For instructions on the features and format of the input 6502 assembler source files,
see the documentations in ./doc/jasm6502.txt (or instructions.txt if you downloaded the binary package)
